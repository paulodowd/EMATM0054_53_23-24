On the far left are infra-red `Light Emitting Diodes` (`LEDs`).  These are enabled or disabled in software.  If they are disabled, the sensor will be behaving under `ambient light` conditions - whatever IR light exists in your working environment.  The two circuit components on the right are the detecting circuits.  The general form of this circuit is repeated for the 5 ground facing sensors.  \n",

        "The detecting circuits utilise a photo-transistor in a small electronic circuit to control the rate of charging and discharging of a capacitor.  The photo-transistor (labelled `Q10` and `Q11` above) is the **`transducer`** in the sensor, the element converting energy from one form to another - the light (photon energy) exposure attenuates the (electron energy) activation of the photo-transistor.  In this circuit, we can imagine that the photo-transistor is restricting the electron flow of the circuit to varying degrees depending on the light conditions.  It might be useful to think of a capacitor (labelled `C53` an `C54` above) as a very small battery which can be charged and discharged quickly.  \n",

Whilst the discharge of the capacitor is a continuous analog signal, a `digitalRead()` will register either `HIGH` or `LOW` depending on the voltage of the capacitor with respect to a logic threshold voltage.  We always expect digital logic to work in this way, and it is a characteristic which makes digital electronic circuits robust to `signal noise`.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the above illustration, we can observe how a slower discharge means more time will elapse before `digitalRead()` registers a `LOW` state.  Therefore, the exposure of the photo-transistor to IR light is represented by the `time` taken for the capacitor discharge to transition from logic `HIGH` to logic `LOW`.  On the left, `dt` is 1000 microseconds (slow discharge), whilst on the right `dt` is 100 microseconds (fast discharge).  These are example values.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process might seem unnecessarily complicated.  A reasonable question would be, \"why not use the ADC?\" or, \"why measure the time of discharge?\".  The answer is that microcontrollers typically have a small number of `ADC` **`channels`**, or pins to take analog measurements.  Furthermore, the 3Pi+ has been designed to use every single pin available on the 32u4 microcontroller, and so some compromises were necessary in the design.  By instead measuring the time taken for a capacitor discharge, a general purpose `digital pin` (normally binary, 0 or 1) can be be used.  Whilst a digital pin is used, the method retains a continuous measurement of the sensor.  \n",

As noted above, an `unsigned long` is `returned` by `millis()` and `micros()` because it will store very large positive-only numbers.  It helps to remember that variables take up a reserved amount of space in computer memory.  We learnt that an `unsigned long` represents values across 32-bits, or 4 bytes (4 sets of 8 bits), of reserved memory.\n",

        "In this exercise we will write code to use all the line sensors more easily, this means `DN1`, `DN2`, `DN3`, `DN4` and `DN5`.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create this functionality, there are two main approaches we can take that both involve creating our own function:\n",
        "- copy and paste Algorithm 1 code for each sensor, changing the pin assignment.  This would create 5 seperate functions, and we can then name them something like `readLineSensor1()`, `readLineSensor2`, `readLineSensor3`, etc.\n",
        "- write 1 function, and use the argument (input) to the function to select which sensor is being read.  We might call this function `readLineSensor(number)`\n",
        "\n",
        "In general, it is preferable to use the second case.  One reason for this is because we would write less code overall, and this means there would be less code for bugs (errors) to occur.  For example, if we did copy-and-paste 5 times, and later we realised there was an error, we would need to make sure we changed this in all 5 functions.  It would be easy to forget this, and spend many hours wondering why your robot has odd behaviour.  Do not underestimate how much time programming is spent debugging!\n",

        "\n",
        "In this final section, we will take what we have learnt about operating the line sensors with `micros()` and develop a new general technique to help organise which tasks are executed and when.  \n",
        "\n",
        "So far in our software for the 3Pi+ we have written all our code within the `loop()`.  We have written this code to execute on every iteration.  In the examples, you may have noticed the following line at the bottom of `loop()`:\n",
        "\n",
        "```c\n",
        "  // A short delay to keep the timing\n",
        "  // of this code consistent for now.\n",
        "  delay(100);\n",
        "```\n",
        "Here, `delay(100)` has been used to create a consistent timing for the `loop()` execution.  In general, it is useful to attempt to make your program execution as predictable as possible.  Most often, we will evaluate our robotic system `empirically` - meaning, through observation of it's activity.  If our software is unpredictable, it becomes very difficult to understand what the robot is doing, or to diagnose any faults.  From software alone, theory or logic can not reveal the performance of the robot.  Our robotic system is `situated` and `embedded` within the environment - we expect the robot and the environment to necessarily interact to produce useful behaviours.  \n",
        "\n",
        "However, the `delay()` function is code which `blocks` execution.  The Arduino Reference states:\n",
        "> No other reading of sensors, mathematical calculations, or pin manipulation can go on during the delay function, so in effect, it brings most other activity to a halt.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using `delay()` means that our robot essentially stops processing for the requested interval.   Obviously, this would mean our robot might not be able to respond to a change in the environment.  When we have used `delay(100)` (halting execution for 100 milliseconds), we have essentially forced `loop()` to execute at a slow rate of 10 times a second (10hertz, 10hz).  Remember that `loop()` is not called again until the `loop()` function itself finishes (returns).  \n",
        "\n",
        "An obvious solution might be to remove the `blocking` function `delay()`.  However, now our `loop()` will execute in an uncontrolled way.  This means that the timing of `loop()` may change per iteration depending on which code has been run.  As we have observed with our line sensor measurement process - the timing of the code can vary.  This might seem like a minor issue, but it will become significant as the complexity of your program (and robot behaviour) increases.  \n",
        "\n",
        "In the future, we might have a number of tasks to update within `loop()`, for example:\n",
        "- reading the line sensors\n",
        "- updating the line following behaviour\n",
        "- measuring the angular velocity of the wheels\n",
        "- calculating a feedback signal for the motor control\n",
        "- calculating odometry to track the robot position\n",
        "- monitoring the robot progress through the series of tasks\n",
        "- reporting debug information back to you\n",
        "- etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "Each of the above subtasks will have a different level of priority within the system.  We can also ask ourselves which subtasks need to be responded to quickly, and which others can be updated slowly. For example:\n",
        "- **fast reponse:** responding to changes in the position of the line under the robot.  If we don't update this quickly enough, the robot might lose track of the line.  \n",
        "- **slow response:** updating the tracking of the robot progress through the whole line following challenge.  Transitions through desired behaviours might necessarily be slow - e.g., we might permit the robot to come off the line for 2 seconds before we consider it \"lost\".  \n",
        "\n",
        "If we can instead schedule subtasks in time, we can improve our code with the following rationale:\n",
        "- subtasks that do not require high frequency updates can be given an infrequent execution, which means they do not consume computing resources on the remaining `loop()` cycles.\n",
        "- your code can be organised with a regular update cycle that takes account for operations with `non-deterministic` execution - such as the known variability of time for the line sensor reading process.  \n",
        "- the readability of your code can be improved, because it will be clear what parts of the program are executing when - as opposed to a long sequential script with no `flow control` (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_flow#:~:text=In%20computer%20science%2C%20control%20flow,from%20a%20declarative%20programming%20language.\">control of flow</a>).\n",
